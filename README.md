# Overlay Â· About

Overlay is an application to overlay an image and use it as a guide.
The most common scenario to use it is in web development.

### How it works ###

1. Open Overlay (yeah, obvious step...)
2. **Drag and drop an image** (jpg, png or gif) into the drop area.
3. Place Overlay whatever you want (over Chrome for example) and lock the window (**L** key).
4. Develop you web page, try to make it exactly as the image (your art director will love you)
