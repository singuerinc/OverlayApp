# About

Overlay is an application to overlay an image and use it as a guide.
The most common scenario to use is in web development.

## How it works ##

1. Open Overlay (yeah, obvious step...)
2. Drag and drop an image (jpg, png or gif) into the dropdown area.
3. Place Overlay whatever you want (Chrome for example) and lock the window.
4. Develop you web page and try to make exactly as the image (you art director will love you)
